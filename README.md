# Triple equals collections for kotlin

Collections that use "triple equals" for equality. Primitives are compared by value, objects - by reference. 

Implementation leverages javascript native Set and Map implementations, and also uses array ([]) for list
which I believe is faster than whatever kotlin comes with out of the box.
